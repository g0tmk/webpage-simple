TODO: become a better writer

COVER LETTER sentences:
I've been writing code for a long time now, and i've come to
realize it's 20% coding and 80% learning.

If there is one thing exploring different technologies has 
taught me, it is that there are infinite different ways to 
solve a given problem -- and that the most comfortable way is 
rarely the best.

There are new platforms, libraries, and tools released every 
day and I consider keeping up with them the single most 
important thing any programmer can do.

              <h2>about</h2>

              <p>
                I'm a Computer Engineer currently living in Southern California.
                Saying that I love to program would be an understatement. Programming is an essential part of who I am, and all of my projects, professional and personal, involve progamming in some form.
              </br>
                I could do it all day, every day. No really.
              </p>
              <p>
                I started programmng over 10 years ago when I was a freshman in high school. 
                Soon after diving into the vast world of code, I was introduced to a new idea, one that would change not just my life, but the lives of everyone: Bitcoin.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the next few years, my PC spent its days mining Bitcoin; over the course of three years, I managed to pay off the cost of the three video cards I used, and mined approximately 50 Bitcoins.
                </br>
                ...wish I still had those.
              </p>

              <h2>experience</h2>
              <p>
                After mining Bitcoin in high school, I continued to engage my interest in cryptocurrency, hosting a few nodes and staying up to date on cryptonews.
                My interest was re-piqued with the launch of Ethereum in 2015, and I began learning how to write smart contracts.
                <!-- TODO: add another sentence about smart contracts -->
                More recently, I have been exploring different ways to visualize blockchain data, and have developed multiple interfaces which are published for public use.
                A bunch of people look at them every day.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have worked in a few different fields, including embedded aerospace, distributed systems, and app development.
                I've managed to get a decent amount of experience in encryption as well.
                I invented a generator design that works well at low RPMs, all but eliminating the need of wind turbine gearboxes.
                I also assisted my former high school in becoming the first to <a href="https://www.vcs.net/page.cfm?p=501">send experiments</a> to the ISS.

            I'm (usually) quite responsive.
